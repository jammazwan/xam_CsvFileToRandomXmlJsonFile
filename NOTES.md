### CsvFileToRandomXmlJsonFile NOTES:

To re-emphasize what is also stated elsewhere, this project works, but is **_too complex to follow the main objective of [projects in this series]_**(https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.x_index), which is to provide very isolated and small scope so you could instantly grok what is going on.

This project was created to create four files which were needed for other projects to consume:

 * [employees.json](https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.shared/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/json/employees.json)
 * [employees.xml](https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.shared/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/xml/employees.xml)
 * [shop.json](https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.shared/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/json/shop.json)
 * [shop.xml](https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.shared/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/xml/shop.xml)
 
### Nuances:

There are many nuances such as how to pretty print, and not, split, aggregate, etc. 

As stated above these are much easier to learn in more projects with more isolated scope

### To Run

 * Run XamTest
